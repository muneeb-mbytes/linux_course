We believe that learning should be open and free source for everyone . "Anything can be learned, if you are truely enthusiastic about it . All things are possible because anything can be learned ". Anyone who is curious about learning the linux commands  can see this project and get practical knowledge .

This project is about the linux commands .  In this  course, we include frequently used commands from basic to intermidate level of linux . For each command , the explaination and frequently used variations are included with its practical use in the CLI operating system . The interface of the project is user friendly.
For giving the user practical knowledge in this course for  each command , the screenshots ,gifs ,lablinks  and cheat sheet are attached. 
This project's home page has included the index of commands so that user can easily go that particular page where user want to go .

 Steps for lab execution-
 1. Go to your CLI system . Log in to the CLI system .

 2. Make a directory for the course in your CLI system . Use the "mkdir <NEW_DIR_Name> <Enter>" . Now the directory is created .
  This directory is empty .  This can be check by using the "ls" command . We will clone our course into it . 
  Below image clearly show it .
